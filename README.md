# Creating a WireGuard Configuration

<p class="callout info">In order for the WireGuard solution to work properly, it is necessary to create, among others: interface for Wireguard and configure other settings</p>

##### **WireGuard's** configuration is available in the menu item **VPN servers-&gt;WireGuard**

[![image-1671005452213.png](https://doc.puq.info/uploads/images/gallery/2022-12/scaled-1680-/image-1671005452213.png)](https://doc.puq.info/uploads/images/gallery/2022-12/image-1671005452213.png)

To create a new **WireGuard** server, click the Create button.

[![image-1671005591390.png](https://doc.puq.info/uploads/images/gallery/2022-12/scaled-1680-/image-1671005591390.png)](https://doc.puq.info/uploads/images/gallery/2022-12/image-1671005591390.png)

The system will automatically fill in the form for creating a new server with unique data.

You can change the data if necessary.

- **Name** - This is a unique configuration name, this name appears in the system as the main configuration model of the **WireGuard** interface, this parameter cannot be changed later
- **Private key/Public key -** Keys for encrypting the traffic of the WireGuard interface, the system generated new keys, but you can set them yourself when creating the **WireGuard** interface
- **Interface name -** Name of the **WireGuard** network interface in the system, this parameter cannot be changed
- **IP/MASK -**The parameters of the internal network of clients of this **WireGuard** interface, the address that is specified will be assigned to the interface and for all clients of this interface it will be the default gateway.
- **Internal Traffic -** Allow or deny traffic exchange between the client of this interface
- **Port -** Port on which the interface will listen for incoming connections
- **External IP -** The public IP address that will be used in the interface configuration, NAT will be organized through this address for all clients of this interface. **The address must be public and configured on the server**.
- **DNS 1/DNS 2 -** DNS servers that will be issued to the client of this interface
- **Bandwidth download/Bandwidth upload -** conditional value for the throughput of each peer connected to this **WireGuard** interface. This data will be automatically applied when creating a VPN client for this WireGuard interface.
- **Persistent Keepalive -** A sensible interval that works with a wide variety of firewalls is 25 seconds. Setting it to 0 turns the feature off, which is the default, since most users will not need this, and it makes **WireGuard** slightly more chatty
- **IKEv2 Enabled -** Enables **IKEv2** protocol support for this interface. If set to **YES** then users of this interface will connect to the server using the **IKEv2** protocol


# Create a server certificate

<p class="callout info">Before creating a server certificate, you must create or import a root certificate.</p>

Go to menu item **VPN servers -&gt; IKEv2**

[![image-1670924167899.png](https://doc.puq.info/uploads/images/gallery/2022-12/scaled-1680-/image-1670924167899.png)](https://doc.puq.info/uploads/images/gallery/2022-12/image-1670924167899.png)

You need to fill in the required fields such as:

- **Server Domain**
- **Server IP**
- **Common name**
- **Organization**

Then click the button **Generate SERVER certificate**

After these steps, the **Server certificate and private key** will be generated.  
Information about the certificate will be available in the same place.

[![image-1670924293587.png](https://doc.puq.info/uploads/images/gallery/2022-12/scaled-1680-/image-1670924293587.png)](https://doc.puq.info/uploads/images/gallery/2022-12/image-1670924293587.png)

To remove the server certificate, use the **Delete SERVER certificate** button

After a successful server certificate generation process, the IKEv2 server transitions to the enabled state.

##### IKEv2 section

Actual data from the system about the connection in the **IKEv2** protocol

##### WireGuard

Actual data from the system about the connection in the **WireGuard** protocol

##### Firewall Mangle

The actual data is taken from the system firewall, these are rules that mark traffic from the client and to the client for bandwidth limitation purposes and to collect traffic statistics, with statistics on packet counters and traffic passing through these rules.  
While the system is reading the brush value, the counter is reset to zero.

##### Traffic control

The actual data is taken from the system with the Traffic Control configuration, it shows that the interfaces are involved in traffic filtering in order to limit the rate for clients of this interface.

##### Traffic

Actual traffic usage in the current month

There is also a section with the configuration of the **WireGuard** client in the form of a QR code and in text form
