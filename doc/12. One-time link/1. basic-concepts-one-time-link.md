One-time link helps to transfer the VPN connection configuration to the client in a secure way and allows you to greatly simplify the setup of a new connection.

>In order for one-time links to work, you need to have an SSL certificate installed on the PUQVPNCP panel.  
Otherwise, the connection will not be encrypted, which means that the transmitted data about the VPN connection is at risk of being intercepted.

>It is possible to automatically generate links via API. If you have a panel license, you can use it. There is also a [ready-made solution for the WHMCS panel](https://doc.puq.info/books/wireguard-business-vpn-whmcs-module "WireGuard Business-VPN WHMCS module") that allows you to automate this process.

>>Attention, it is strongly recommended not to send one-time links through public messengers or mail systems. Such systems tend to enter this link for analysis, and naturally, after such an action, this link will not work for the end user.

>One-time link is fully customizable, you can insert your logo, text, links to instructions, links to VPN clients, etc.

### To get One-time link, you need to generate it per client manually (if you do not use the automation mechanisms mentioned earlier). Go to VPN Accounts and add/edit an account.
