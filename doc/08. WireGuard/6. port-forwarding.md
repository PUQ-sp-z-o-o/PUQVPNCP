**Port forwarding** is a networking technique used to allow external devices to access services running on a local network. Essentially, it involves redirecting incoming network traffic from a specific port on a router or firewall to a specific device or port on the internal network. This allows devices outside the local network to access resources such as web servers, FTP servers, or game servers hosted on a local network. Port forwarding is often used for remote access to devices, for example, accessing a security camera or a home automation system from a remote location.

To access port forwarding settings, select the Wireguard server for which you wish to configure port forwarding and click on the **port forwarding** button.

When you access the port forwarding settings, a list of all currently forwarded ports from the external IP address to the internal account will be displayed. If you wish to add a new port forwarding rule, simply fill out the necessary information and click on the "**ADD**" button. Conversely, if you need to remove an existing port forwarding rule, click on the "**DELETE**" button associated with the relevant entry. These options provide a great deal of flexibility in managing your port forwarding settings to ensure that external devices can access the resources on your VPN network that you want to make available.
