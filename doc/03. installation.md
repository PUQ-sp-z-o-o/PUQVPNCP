>It is important to follow instructions during the installation of VPN server software for several reasons:
>
> - Following instructions ensures that the software is installed correctly and all required components are present. This can prevent errors and ensure that the software functions properly.
> - Instructions often include important information about system requirements, compatibility, and potential issues that may arise during installation. By following these instructions, you can avoid encountering problems that could affect the performance or stability of the software.
> - Instructions may also include important information about configuring and setting up the software, such as creating user accounts, assigning permissions, and establishing connections with other systems or devices. By following these instructions, you can ensure that the software is set up correctly and ready to use.
> - Finally, following instructions during installation is a good practice that can help you avoid wasting time, effort, and resources. It can also help you avoid making mistakes that could be difficult or costly to fix later.

>>We suggest installing the software on a clean, freshly installed Debian/Ubuntu server.

>>We issue all comments after logging into the SSH terminal window as the root user.

> ! Linux kernels less than 5.6 (&lt;=5.5) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">did not include Wireguard</span> as a feature in the upstream kernel code. Adding Wireguard support to these (older) kernels is possible via additional modules. *Therefore, we suggest using the latest Debian or Ubuntu distributions. If you use the versions of the operating system specified in the requirements, you do not need to pay attention to this message.*
