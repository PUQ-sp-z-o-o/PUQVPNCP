- **Private key/Public key -** Keys for encrypting the traffic of the WireGuard interface, the system generated new keys, but you can set them yourself when creating the **WireGuard** interface
- **IP/MASK -** The parameters of the internal network of clients of this **WireGuard** interface, the address that is specified will be assigned to the interface and for all clients of this interface it will be the default gateway.
- **Internal Traffic -** Allow or deny traffic exchange between the client of this interface
- **Port -** Port on which the interface will listen for incoming connections
- **External IP -** The public IP address that will be used in the interface configuration, NAT will be organized through this address for all clients of this interface. **The address must be public and configured on the server**.
- **DNS 1/DNS 2 -** DNS servers that will be issued to the client of this interface
- **Bandwidth download/Bandwidth upload -** conditional value for the throughput of each peer connected to this **WireGuard** interface. This data will be automatically applied when creating a VPN client for this WireGuard interface.
