# Technical requirements

- Operating systems: Debian 11+ (amd64), Ubuntu 20+ (amd64)
- Real, public IP address on server interface
- Domain name for the server
- **PUQVPNCP**
- Installed packages **wireguard wireguard-dkms wireguard-tools** *(Included in the installation process)*

# **Installation**

>We issue all comments after logging into the SSH terminal window as the root user.

>**Linux kernels less than 5.6 (&lt;=5.5) did not include Wireguard as a feature in the upstream kernel code. Adding Wireguard support to these (older) kernels is possible via additional modules**

**Check kernel version**

```shell
uname -sr

Linux 5.10.0-10-amd64
```

```shell
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
reboot
```

For Debian 10: **WireGuard** is in Debian backported repo. Hence, enable backports as follows, run:

```shell
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main contrib non-free' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/buster-backports.list"
sudo apt update
```

```shell
apt-get install wireguard wireguard-dkms wireguard-tools -y
```

# Checking installed packages

### Checking the **wireguard** status

```shell
dpkg -s wireguard
```

Output should looks similar to this:

```shell
Package: wireguard
Status: install ok installed
Priority: optional
Section: net
Installed-Size: 17
Maintainer: Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg@fifthhorseman.net>
Architecture: all
Version: 1.0.20210223-1
Depends: wireguard-modules (>= 0.0.20191219) | wireguard-dkms (>= 0.0.20200121-2), wireguard-tools (>= 1.0.20210223-1)
Description: fast, modern, secure kernel VPN tunnel (metapackage)
 WireGuard is a novel VPN that runs inside the Linux Kernel and uses
 state-of-the-art cryptography (the "Noise" protocol). It aims to be
 faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding
 the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant
 than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for
 running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for
 many different circumstances. It runs over UDP.
 .
 This metapackage explicitly depends on both the kernel module and the
 userspace tooling.
