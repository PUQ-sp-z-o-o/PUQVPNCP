6. After you click on the button that allows you to create a new connection, you will be presented with several options. Now we will use the QR code scanning method. Click on the "SCAN FROM QR CODE" button to start scanning.

    <p class="callout info">It is worth noting that if you are using the application for the first time, your device will ask you if you can allow access to the camera. You need to allow access to the camera, otherwise scanning will not be possible.</p>
7. After you can already start scanning and see that your device is ready, point your camera at the QR code you received.  
    <p class="callout info">It is worth noting the system will ask your password</p>
