The system will automatically fill in the form for creating a new server with unique data.

You can change the data if necessary.

- **Name** - This is a unique configuration name, this name appears in the system as the main configuration model of the **WireGuard** interface, this parameter cannot be changed later
- **Private key/Public key -** Keys for encrypting the traffic of the WireGuard interface, the system generated new keys, but you can set them yourself when creating the **WireGuard** interface
- **Interface name -** Name of the **WireGuard** network interface in the system, this parameter cannot be changed
- **IP/MASK -** The parameters of the internal network of clients of this **WireGuard** interface, the address that is specified will be assigned to the interface and for all clients of this interface it will be the default gateway.
- **Internal Traffic -** Allow or deny traffic exchange between the client of this interface
- **Port -** Port on which the interface will listen for incoming connections
- **External IP -** The public IP address that will be used in the interface configuration, NAT will be organized through this address for all clients of this interface. **The address must be public and configured on the server**.
- **DNS 1/DNS 2 -** DNS servers that will be issued to the client of this interface
- **Bandwidth download/Bandwidth upload -** conditional value for the throughput of each peer connected to this **WireGuard** interface. This data will be automatically applied when creating a VPN client for this WireGuard interface.
- **Persistent Keepalive -** A sensible interval that works with a wide variety of firewalls is 25 seconds. Setting it to 0 turns the feature off, which is the default, since most users will not need this, and it makes **WireGuard** slightly more chatty
- **IKEv2 Enabled -** Enables **IKEv2** protocol support for this interface. If set to **YES** then users of this interface will connect to the server using the **IKEv2** protocol
