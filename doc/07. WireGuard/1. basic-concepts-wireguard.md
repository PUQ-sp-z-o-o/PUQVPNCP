 Since version 1.3 **PUQVPNCP** supports VPN protocol [**WireGuard**](https://www.wireguard.com/)

>**WireGuard** is the main **VPN** protocol of the **PUQVPNCP** system.   
This means that the WireGuard protocol must be installed and configured correctly. If you have carefully carried out the panel installation process according to our instructions, then all packages are ready to work and you do not need to do anything else.

>The primary place where configuration changes are made is the WireGuard interface, the internal network address space is configured on the interface, the public IP address for NAT implementation, as well as DNS server settings, and VPN clients are connected to the interface and much more.  
WireGard interface cannot be disabled (only removed)
